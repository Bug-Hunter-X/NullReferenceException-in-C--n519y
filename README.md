# NullReferenceException in C# 

This repository demonstrates a common coding error in C#: the NullReferenceException.  The `bug.cs` file contains code that throws this exception. The solution, found in `bugSolution.cs`, addresses this issue and shows how to avoid the error.

The error arises when you attempt to access a member (like a property or method) of an object that is currently null. This typically happens when an object hasn't been properly initialized or when a method unexpectedly returns null.
